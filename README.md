# Project Shellfish
## Author: Bobby Yang (Batch 2)

## Synopsis
Project Shellfish is an automated task checker for Holberton School's 0x15. C - Simple Shell project.

## File Breakdown

## Using
1) Install Shellfish
```bash
$ chmod u+x install.sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

We are using sudo, so be sure you know what you are doing first! Don't trust us, look in the code!


2) Run `shellfish` in your simple shell project directory
```bash
$ pwd
/julienbarbier/bobbyiscool/simple-shell
$ shellfish
```
You can specify which tasks you would like to check.
```bash
$ shellfish 0 1 2 3
```

## Updating
If you do not specify, shellfish will run all of the checks.

To update the tests, we've built-in an update command that will pull the repo again, and run install again, and removes itself.

### Please look into the code before you use it!
